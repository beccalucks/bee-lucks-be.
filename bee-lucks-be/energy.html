  </h3></a>
  </div>
<h4>By Becca Thomas Loux

  <article><p>
    Linked above is a visualisation of data showing UK energy usage from renewable resources.</p>
    <p>It was originally submitted as an assessment project for my Data Viz module for my MSc Computational & Data Journalism at Cardiff University taught by Martin Chorley. The project uses Java Script and three libraries: DataWrapper, D3.js and Plot.ly. The individual charts are interactive and annotated, and display energy usage by source and occupation from the years 1990-2015.</p>
    <p>As the third visualisation runs on a Python server, make sure you run one from the command line to see the small percentage of the UK's total energy consumption that comes from renewable resources.</p>
    <p>Data for this project is from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>
